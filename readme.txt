Understanding Basic Serial Monitor Code with Arduino

Description:
This Arduino sketch provides a basic example to help you understand the fundamentals of using the Serial Monitor. The code demonstrates how to read data from the user and display messages on the Serial Monitor. It serves as a simple yet effective starting point for learning about Serial communication with Arduino.

Features:
- Initializes and utilizes the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE.
- Displays a welcome message and prompts the user for input.
- Reads the data entered by the user and displays it on the Serial Monitor.

Usage:
1. Upload the provided code to your Arduino board.
2. Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (Tools -> Serial Monitor) with a baud rate of 9600.
3. Observe the welcome message and prompt displayed in the Serial Monitor.
4. Enter data (text or numbers) and press 'Enter'.
5. The data you entered will be displayed as "You entered: [your data]" on the Serial Monitor.

Explore and Experiment:
Take this opportunity to experiment with data input and observe the output in the Serial Monitor. Modify the code and build upon it to create more complex projects involving Serial communication.
